### Preface
This is my first full stack development project, as well as my first website development project. I didn't know any CSS frameworks (like bootstrap) and back end frameworks (like MVC) yet. So, this website project looks a bit crude.

### ER Diagram
This is a hospital register system project. It supports register function for the patient, and diagnosis system for the doctor. It uses <!-- outline-start -->SQL Server as database and C# asp as back end of the system. <!-- outline-end -->

This is the ER Diagram
